#What subject do you like the most? And why?

##I think my favorite topic about informatics is cybersecurity or programming, I'm unsure, but I love both

<In programming, these languages ​​that I like stand out.>

1. Python
2. Java
3. JavaScript

{In cybersecurity, I like}

- Defend systems
- Do attack tests
- Crypt files

[What I would like the most is to combine both areas]

· Do attack programms
· Play capture the flag
